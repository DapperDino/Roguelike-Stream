# Roguelike-Stream

Repo for my Roguelike Streaming.

If you would like to download and use this project please note that I have been using the paid asset: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041

If you already have this asset then you should be just fine to open up this project and then import the Odin Inspector.

On the other hand, if you don't have the asset then the have the task of removing all the of the using statements for this asset from my scripts and then removing any tags such as [Required] that are part of the addon. Everything should work just fine as the addon is mainly for enhancing the Unity UI though there are some improved/added serialization features so you may have to create your own small workarounds when it comes to that. But I guess in the end that is a good challenge rather than just being able to copy+paste and have everything working right away. :)

I hope you enjoy and it would mean a lot if you would leave a follow on my Twitch channel where I have been streaming all of the development for this project: https://www.twitch.tv/dapper_dino.
